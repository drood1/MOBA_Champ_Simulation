Unnamed MOBA Project by Karl Olsen
October 9th 2017 Build

**Recommended playing on Windowed Mode

Standard MOBA controls:
-Right click to move/use auto-attacks ("A-move" not yet implemented)

-Q Shoots a projectile a fixed distance in a straight line towards the cursor, dealing damage to the first enemy hit. For those familiar with League of Legends, think Ezreal Q.

W- After pressing W, click on an allied hero (AI or self) to apply a shield to them

E- After pressing E, click on an enemy target to apply a DoT effect to them (represented by pulsing purple blocks) for a few seconds. This is based off of LoL's Malzahar's E.

R- Shoots out 12 damaging projectiles in a circle around the player's location. After a few seconds, these projectiles will converge on the player's location, regardless of where they moved. These projectiles can also pass through and damage multiple enemies. This is inspired by Talon's ultimate in LoL.
